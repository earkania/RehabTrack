# RehabTrack Development Progress

## Project Overview

RehabTrack is a personal health companion Flutter application designed for tracking medications, health measurements, exercise, and doctor visits. The app targets offline-first usage on Android (Pixel 7) with planned future support for multiple user profiles.

**Architecture:** Clean Architecture — `core/`, `data/`, `domain/`, `presentation/` layer separation.

**Technology Stack:**

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Flutter (SDK ^3.12.2) |
| Language | Dart |
| State Management | Riverpod |
| Navigation | GoRouter |
| Database | Drift (SQLite ORM) |
| Serialization | Freezed, JSON Serializable |
| Notifications | flutter_local_notifications |
| Theming | Material 3 |
| Localization | Flutter l10n (ARB files) |

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1 — Project Foundation

**Status:** Completed

**What was done:**

- Flutter project initialized with `com.earkania.rehabtrack` applicationId
- `pubspec.yaml` configured with foundation dependencies
- Material 3 theme system with teal seed color (`#2E7D6F`), light and dark modes, system theme following
- GoRouter navigation with `ShellRoute` providing bottom `NavigationBar`
- 5-tab navigation structure: Today, Health, Activities, Records, Settings
- Localization setup: English and Georgian (`ka`) with 29 translation keys
- Android build configured: `compileSdk`/`minSdk`/`targetSdk` delegated to Flutter, Java 17 compatibility
- Release signing prepared (placeholder debug keys)
- `ProviderScope` wrapping entire app for Riverpod

### Phase 2 — Database and Data Layer

**Status:** Completed

**What was done:**

**Drift Database Setup:**
- Schema version: `1`
- Database file: `rehabtrack.sqlite` in application documents directory
- Migration strategy: `onCreate` creates all tables then seeds initial data
- 17 tables registered in `@DriftDatabase` annotation

**Tables (17):**

| Table | Module |
|---|---|
| Profiles | Profile |
| Medications | Medication |
| MedicationSchedules | Medication |
| MedicationLogs | Medication |
| MeasurementTypes | Measurement |
| MeasurementRecords | Measurement |
| MeasurementSchedules | Measurement |
| ExerciseTypes | Exercise |
| ExerciseGoals | Exercise |
| ExerciseLogs | Exercise |
| Doctors | Doctor |
| DoctorVisits | Doctor |
| DocumentAttachments | Document |
| DietPlans | Diet |
| DietItems | Diet |
| HealthTemplates | Template |
| AppSettings | Settings |

**Domain Entities (10 files):**

- `profile.dart` — Profile
- `medication.dart` — Medication, MedicationSchedule, MedicationLog
- `measurement.dart` — MeasurementType, MeasurementRecord, MeasurementSchedule
- `exercise.dart` — ExerciseType, ExerciseGoal, ExerciseLog
- `doctor.dart` — Doctor, DoctorVisit
- `document_attachment.dart` — DocumentAttachment
- `diet.dart` — DietPlan, DietItem
- `health_template.dart` — HealthTemplate
- `app_setting.dart` — AppSetting
- `schedule_config.dart` — ScheduleConfig sealed class (DailySchedule, FixedTimesSchedule, IntervalDaysSchedule)

**Domain Enums (6):**

- `Gender` — male, female, other
- `MedicationDoseStatus` — pending, taken, missed, skipped
- `VisitStatus` — scheduled, completed, cancelled
- `DocumentCategory` — labResult, prescription, dietPlan, other
- `DietCategory` — recommended, avoid, limit
- `MeasurementCategory` — vital, metabolic, body, custom

**Data Access Objects (9):**

- `ProfileDao`, `MedicationDao`, `MeasurementDao`, `ExerciseDao`, `DoctorDao`, `DocumentDao`, `DietDao`, `HealthTemplateDao`, `AppSettingDao`

**Repository Structure:**

| Layer | Count | Files |
|---|---|---|
| Interfaces (domain) | 7 | profile, medication, measurement, exercise, doctor, document, settings |
| Implementations (data) | 7 | profile, medication, measurement, exercise, doctor, document, settings |

Note: Diet module has a DAO but no dedicated repository yet.

**Providers (9 total):**

- `databaseProvider` — singleton AppDatabase
- `profileRepositoryProvider`
- `medicationRepositoryProvider`
- `measurementRepositoryProvider`
- `exerciseRepositoryProvider`
- `doctorRepositoryProvider`
- `documentRepositoryProvider`
- `settingsRepositoryProvider`
- `localeProvider` — locale management (separate file)

**Seed Data:**
- 5 built-in measurement types: Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Weight, Blood Glucose, Temperature
- 3 health templates: Cardiac Recovery, Diabetes Management, General Wellness

### Phase 3 — Notification Infrastructure

**Status:** Completed

**What was done:**

**Dependencies Added:**
- `flutter_local_notifications: ^18.0.1` — Cross-platform local notifications
- `timezone: ^0.10.1` — Timezone-aware scheduling

**Services Created:**

| Service | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `NotificationService` | `data/services/notification/` | Low-level notification capabilities |
| `NotificationScheduler` | `data/services/notification/` | Converts domain schedules to notifications |
| `ScheduleRecoveryService` | `data/services/notification/` | Restores notifications on app start |
| `BatteryOptimizationHelper` | `data/services/notification/` | Battery optimization detection |

**Notification Channels (5):**

| Channel ID | Name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `rehabtrack_medications` | Medication Reminders | Medication dose reminders |
| `rehabtrack_measurements` | Measurement Reminders | Health measurement reminders |
| `rehabtrack_appointments` | Appointment Reminders | Doctor visit reminders |
| `rehabtrack_exercise` | Exercise Reminders | Exercise activity reminders |
| `rehabtrack_general` | General Notifications | General app notifications |

**Notification Actions:**
- `Taken` — Mark dose as taken
- `Snooze` — Postpone reminder
- `Skip` — Skip dose

**Domain Schedule Model:**
- `ScheduleConfig` sealed class already existed from Phase 2
- Supports: `DailySchedule`, `FixedTimesSchedule`, `IntervalDaysSchedule`

**Providers Added:**

| Provider | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `notificationServiceProvider` | Singleton NotificationService |
| `notificationSchedulerProvider` | NotificationScheduler instance |
| `scheduleRecoveryServiceProvider` | ScheduleRecoveryService instance |
| `batteryOptimizationHelperProvider` | BatteryOptimizationHelper instance |

**Android Configuration:**
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` — Boot rescheduling
- `VIBRATE` — Notification vibration
- `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` — Precise timing
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` — Android 13+ permission
- `USE_EXACT_ALARM` — Exact alarm support

**Android Integration:**
- Added `flutter_local_notifications: ^18.0.1` to pubspec.yaml
- Enabled core library desugaring in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
- Added `coreLibraryDesugaring("com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.1.4")`
- Enabled `multiDexEnabled = true` in defaultConfig

**Validation Results:**
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `flutter analyze` | Passed (0 issues) |
| `flutter test` | Passed (1/1) |
| `flutter build apk --debug` | Built successfully |
| Pixel 7 debug build/run | Passed |

**Known Limitations:**
- Battery optimization detection is placeholder (requires platform-specific code)
- Boot rescheduling requires app to start (no native receiver)
- Notification actions are infrastructure only — not connected to medication logs yet

## Current Application State

**App launches successfully on Pixel 7.**

**Bottom navigation — 5 tabs:**

| Tab | Route | Screen | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| Today | `/` | TodayScreen | Placeholder — icon + "No data yet" |
| Health | `/health` | HealthScreen | Placeholder — icon + "No data yet" |
| Activities | `/activities` | ActivitiesScreen | Placeholder — icon + "No data yet" |
| Records | `/records` | RecordsScreen | Placeholder — icon + "No data yet" |
| Settings | `/settings` | SettingsScreen | Functional — language switching works |

**Settings screen working features:**
- Language switching (System / English / Georgian)
- Theme toggle placeholder (no-op)
- Notifications toggle placeholder (hardcoded on)
- Security toggle placeholder (hardcoded off)

**Database:** Initializes on first provider access. Schema v1 created with all 17 tables and seed data. Ready for UI integration.

**Notification Infrastructure:** Fully initialized. All services ready for UI integration.

## Current Technical Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Offline-first local database | No backend dependency; data stays on device |
| No backend server | User privacy; no cloud sync in initial scope |
| Clean Architecture | Clear separation of concerns; testable layers |
| Riverpod state management | Modern, compile-safe, testable providers |
| Drift for SQLite | Type-safe, reactive database with code generation |
| GoRouter navigation | Declarative routing with ShellRoute for tab navigation |
| Localization from day one | English + Georgian from initial commit |
| Freezed for entities | Immutable data classes with copyWith, equality |
| Multi-profile architecture | Schema supports multiple profiles; UI starts with single user |

## Important Future Requirements

### Medication Management

- Flexible medication schedules (daily, fixed times, interval days)
- Meal timing instructions: before meal, after meal, with meal, any time
- Medication adherence tracking with dose status history
- Conditional dose logic:
  - Skip dose if measurement is outside threshold (e.g., skip Concor if pulse < 55 bpm)
  - Warning/confirmation rules based on latest measurements
- Optional medication replacement/alternative suggestions:
  - User-defined alternatives for a medication
  - Not mandatory for every medication

### Health Tracking

- Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic)
- Pulse / heart rate
- Weight
- Blood glucose
- Body temperature
- Custom measurements (user-defined types)
- Measurement history and trends

### Exercise

- Walking goals (daily step/distance targets)
- Daily activity logging
- Exercise programs (future)

### Profiles

- Version 1: single active user
- Architecture supports future multi-profile:
  - Self
  - Elderly parents
  - Family members
- Profile switching without data migration

### Templates

- Health profiles/templates for common conditions:
  - Cardiac rehabilitation
  - Hypertension management
  - Diabetes management
  - General wellness
- Templates pre-populate measurement types, exercise goals, and schedules

### Phase 4A — Medication Data Layer (Gaps)

**Status:** Completed

**What was done:**

**Database Schema Changes:**
- Schema version bumped from `1` to `2`
- Added `doseAmount` (TextColumn nullable) to `Medications` table
- Added `doseUnit` (TextColumn nullable) to `Medications` table
- Created new `MedicationAlternatives` table with foreign key to Medications
- Migration strategy handles v1→v2 upgrade (adds columns, creates table)

**MedicationAlternatives Table:**

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER | Primary key, auto-increment |
| medicationId | INTEGER | Foreign key → Medications |
| name | TEXT | Alternative medication name |
| doseAmount | TEXT | Nullable |
| doseUnit | TEXT | Nullable |
| doctorApproved | BOOLEAN | Default false |
| notes | TEXT | Nullable |
| createdAt | DATETIME | Record creation time |

**Domain Entities Updated:**
- `Medication` — added `doseAmount` and `doseUnit` fields with copyWith support
- New `MedicationAlternative` class created in separate file

**DAOs Created/Updated:**
- New `MedicationAlternativesDao` with CRUD operations for alternatives
- `MedicationDao` unchanged (already had all needed methods)

**Repository Layer Updated:**
- `MedicationRepository` interface — added alternative CRUD method signatures
- `MedicationRepositoryImpl` — implemented alternative methods with domain mapping
- Updated `_toDomain` and companion creation for dose fields

**Files Changed:**
- `lib/data/database/tables/medication_tables.dart` — new columns + table
- `lib/data/database/app_database.dart` — schema v2, migration, new DAO getter
- `lib/domain/entities/medication.dart` — dose fields added
- `lib/domain/entities/medication_alternative.dart` — new file
- `lib/data/database/daos/medication_alternatives_dao.dart` — new file
- `lib/domain/repositories/medication_repository.dart` — alternative methods
- `lib/data/repositories/medication_repository_impl.dart` — alternative implementation

**Validation Results:**
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `build_runner` | Completed successfully |
| `flutter analyze` | Passed (0 issues) |
| `flutter test` | Passed (1/1) |

### Phase 4B — Step 1: Foundation

**Status:** Completed

**What was done:**

**AdherenceStats Domain Entity:**
- Created `lib/domain/entities/adherence_stats.dart`
- Separate entity from Medication, following Clean Architecture domain purity (no Flutter, Drift, or Riverpod imports)
- Fields: `taken`, `missed`, `skipped`, `pending`, `total`, `percentage`
- Factory `AdherenceStats.fromLogs(List<MedicationLog> logs)` calculates statistics from medication logs
- Percentage formula: `taken / (taken + missed + skipped) * 100`
- Pending items excluded from denominator
- Division by zero handled safely (returns 0.0)
- Static `empty` const for zero-state

**Active Profile Provider:**
- Created `lib/presentation/providers/profile_provider.dart`
- `activeProfileIdProvider` — `Provider<int?>` returning hardcoded profile ID 1
- Temporary implementation with comment indicating future multi-profile replacement


**EmptyState Widget:**
- Created `lib/presentation/widgets/empty_state.dart`
- Reusable Material 3 widget with properties: `icon`, `title`, `subtitle`, optional `actionLabel`, optional `onAction`
- No medication-specific logic, no hardcoded text
- Used across all 4 placeholder screens (Today, Health, Activities, Records)

**Placeholder Screen Refactoring:**
- Replaced duplicated inline placeholder code in 4 screens with `EmptyState` widget:
  - `lib/presentation/screens/today/today_screen.dart`
  - `lib/presentation/screens/health/health_screen.dart`
  - `lib/presentation/screens/activities/activities_screen.dart`
  - `lib/presentation/screens/records/records_screen.dart`
- Activities screen remains a placeholder — not yet replaced with medication list

**Localization Additions:**
- Added 40+ medication-related keys to `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` and `lib/l10n/app_ka.arb`
- Includes: medication CRUD labels, schedule types, adherence statuses, instructions, placeholders
- Parameterized keys: `dailyAt`, `fixedTimes`, `everyNDays` with placeholders
- Follows existing ARB conventions

**Files Created:**
- `lib/domain/entities/adherence_stats.dart`
- `lib/presentation/providers/profile_provider.dart`
- `lib/presentation/widgets/empty_state.dart`

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/presentation/screens/today/today_screen.dart`
- `lib/presentation/screens/health/health_screen.dart`
- `lib/presentation/screens/activities/activities_screen.dart`
- `lib/presentation/screens/records/records_screen.dart`
- `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`
- `lib/l10n/app_ka.arb`

**Validation Results:**
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `flutter gen-l10n` | Completed successfully |
| `flutter analyze` | Passed (0 issues) |
| `flutter test` | Passed (1/1) |

**Architecture Verification:**
- Presentation layer does not access DAOs directly
- Presentation layer does not use NotificationService directly (pre-existing `notification_provider.dart` pattern unchanged)
- No medication CRUD functionality implemented
- No notification scheduling implemented
- Existing architecture conventions preserved

**Note:** Pre-existing pattern where `notification_provider.dart` imports data-layer notification services directly (not introduced in this step) remains unchanged. All new code follows Clean Architecture boundaries.

## Next Planned Phase

### Phase 4B — Step 2: Medication CRUD

**Planned work:**

- Add medication routes to `app_router.dart`
- Create `MedicationListScreen` (replaces Activities placeholder)
- Create `AddMedicationScreen`
- Create `EditMedicationScreen`
- Create `MedicationDetailScreen`
- Create medication providers (`medicationListProvider`, `medicationProvider`, `activeProfileIdProvider` integration)
- Medication list with status indicators
- Visual schedule editor (daily, fixed times, interval days)
- Medication history (calendar/timeline + adherence stats)
- Notification integration test on real device
- Condition-check flow at reminder time (future)

## Development Rules

- Commit after every completed phase
- Keep documentation updated before moving to next phase
- Test on real Pixel device before moving to next phase
- Avoid implementing features before data model supports future requirements
- Run `flutter analyze` before committing — zero issues required
